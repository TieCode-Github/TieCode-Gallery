# Yi's Personal Gallery 
several days ago, My daughter Yi was born, my whole family member were all very excited, then I was thinking about a special way of recording our wonderful moment with this little child.

Since I am a developer. Several days later, I decided to make this project, Github's wonderful REST APIs make it possible. 

Hope my Little Yi will see this one day and said "Daddy, thank you for this"

I will be much proud of this and myself.
